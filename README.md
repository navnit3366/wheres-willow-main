## üîé Wheres Willow?

### Inspired by "Where's Waldo?"

#### This dataset generator is very simple! 

## Why?

After reading a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7095418359671869440?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on simulating data with Chat GPT, I wanted to use the tutorial for fun!

One thousand data points are generated. There is one "Willow" that will be unique for each simulation. However, this dataset is more useful for EDA and data visualization practice.

## "Random" ...

"Willow" is created by replacing the name of an already randomly generated row. It's likely that the data point is not unique beyond the name. I will try (or someone can help me!) to make it "true", but it might take some time.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è I might have missed something, I'm only human!
